## GitHub
Commits should be staged by relevant grouping of files, where commits should as shortly as possible explain the changes; otherwise a more detailed description is encouraged.

## Modules
Each module, defined as a set of `.h` and `.c` files, must follow the predefined structure, as demonstrated in the `EXAMPLE` module; [`exm.h`][exm_h] and [`exm.c`][exm_c]. These files should be used as templates whenever creating a new module.

[exm_h]: exm.h
[exm_c]: exm.c

#### Module Header
Both files of a module should be described using a module header at the beginning of the document, following the format as defined in the example module files.

#### Sections
Each module should be comprised of the predefined sections, even if unused. If necessary, sections may be added.

#### Function Header
All function definitions should be described using a header (after function name and before curly braces), following the format as defined in the example module. This only affects `.c` files, since header files should never include any function declarations.

#### Includes
Each header-file of a module should include the `#pragma once` include guard. It is illegal to include `.c` files directly.

#### Module Interface
A module (or class) must bear the same name as the `class struct` of that module, although the `class TYPE` should be more descriptive. Non-static modules must have a constructor named `new()` and a destructor named `del()`.

Struct modules should be comprised of:
- Struct Declarations (forward declaration)
- Struct Definition (`struct TYPE`)
- Struct Class (`extern const struct TYPE_CLASS`) with function pointers to public methods.

An example of a `DEMO` module:

**Forward Declarations:**
```C
typedef struct  DEMO DEMO;
typedef enum    DEMO_TYPE DEMO_TYPE;
```

**Struct Definition in `demo.h`:**
```C
struct DEMO
{
	int_u8  	some_variable;
	DEMO_TYPE	type : 1;
};
```

**Struct Class in `demo.h`:**
```C
extern const struct DEMO_CLASS
{
	// Constructor & Destructor
	DEMO*		(*new)(DEMO_TYPE type);
	void 		(*del)(DEMO* this);

	// Methods
	void		(*some_method)(DEMO* this);
} demo;
```

**Struct Class in `demo.c`:**
```C
const struct DEMO_CLASS demo =
{
	// Constructor & Destructor
	.new		= &DEMO_new,
	.del		= &DEMO_del,

	// Methods
	.some_method= &DEMO_some_method
} demo;
```

## Formatting

#### Language
All code, including comments, should be written in _American-English_. Inline code comments are always lowercase, where descriptive text in e.g. headers is sentence case.

#### Indentation
For indentation, tabs of size 4 should be used, indenting each block as defined per a set of curly braces; these must always start on a new line. In some cases, indentation may be used with parentheses, as demonstrated below:

Combination of declarations should _preferably_ be aligned using tabs.

#### Syntax
Per default, code should be written using the following conventions:

| Case                      | Convention                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Keywords                  | `struct`, `enum`, `while`  ...                  |
| Types*                    | `int8_t`, `uint32_t` ...                        |
| Constants                 | `SOME_CONSTANT`                                 |
| Methods                   | `void some_method(int var);`                    |
| Assembly Methods          | `__some_ASM_method(int var);`                   |
| Variables                 | `int some_variable;`                            |
| Pointers (Variables)      | `int* some_variable`                            |
| Struct Type               | `struct EXAMPLE_TYPE{...};`                     |
| Struct Class              | `const struct EXAMPLE_TYPE_CLASS {...} extype;` |
| Struct Variable (private) | `int _some_private_variable`                    |
| Struct Method (public)    | `static void EXAMPLE_TYPE_method(int var)`      |
| Struct Method (private)   | `static void _EXAMPLE_TYPE_method(int var)`     |

\* the predefined types from `<stdint.h>` should be used.

**Furthermore**:

- Single prefixed underscores are reserved for private methods and variables of structs.
- Double prefixed underscores are reserved for ASSEMBLY methods.
- Numerical values should be defined as constants with meaningful names.
- Variables that are desired to be left unchanged must be marked `const`.
- Variables that are susceptible to unexpected changed must be marked `volatile`.
- Methods that take no arguments must be explicitly specified, e.g. `void some_method(void);`.
- The keyword `this` is reserved for method taking a pointer to the object as an argument.
- Bitfields are encouraged in structs if applicable.
- Register assignment should be done using bit masking, e.g. `SOME_REG |= (1 << BIT7)`.
- Arithmetic operations are always to be separated by spaces, e.g. `c = a * (b / 4);`.

#### Cases
In all cases, the use of (early) `return`, `continue` and `break` **is allowed**; albeit `GOTO` is disallowed.

##### While

```C
while(condition)
{
	...
}
```

##### Do While

```C
do
{
	some_method();
} while (condition);
```

##### For
For loops should be indexed using `i`, `j`, `k` etc., unless otherwise specified or required. Execution conditions should preferably be specified as constants.

```C
for(int i = 0; i < SOME_VALUE_MAX; i++)
{
	some_method(i);
}
```

##### If
If statements are to be used when less than 3 expressions are to be tested. Nesting of if statements is highly discouraged.

```C
if(condition)
{
	some_method();
}
else if (condition)
{
	return;
}
else
{
	some_other_method();
}
```

##### Switch
If more than 3 conditions are to be sequentially tested, a switch statement is required; these should be written with plentiful of spacing. A `default` case is always required and no break scenarios must be highlighted using comments.

```C
switch (select_expression)
{
	case CASE_0:

		statement_0_0();
		...
		statement_0_n();
		break;

	case CASE_1:

		statement_1_0();
		...
		statement_1_n();

		/* no break */

	case CASE_M:

		statement_m_0();
		...
		statement_m_n();
		break;

	default:

		statement_default();
};
```
